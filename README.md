### Project Description
This is a Next.js application built with Firebase Studio that translates English song lyrics into Malayalam and generates an AI-powered vocal performance.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The Ugly truth of AI translation into Malayalam.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Simply allowing it to do by itself!!

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages:** TypeScript, CSS
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Key Libraries:**
  - `genkit` & `@genkit-ai/googleai`: For AI-powered translation and text-to-speech synthesis.
  - `shadcn/ui`: For the UI component library (built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS).
  - `lucide-react`: For icons.
  - `zod`: For data validation.
  - `wav`: For processing audio data.
- **Tools:**
  - `npm`: Package manager.
  - `next`: For building and running the Next.js application.
  - `genkit-cli`: For running the Genkit AI flows locally.

For Hardware:
- This is a web-based application. No special hardware is required beyond a standard computer with a modern web browser and an internet connection.

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in your project's root directory:
```bash
npm install
```

# Run
To run the application in development mode, you will need to run two separate commands in two separate terminals:

1.  Start the Next.js frontend:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Start the Genkit AI service:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

# Build
To create a production-ready build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
